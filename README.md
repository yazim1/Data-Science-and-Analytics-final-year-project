# Data-Science-and-Analytics-final-year-project
This project is a Gold price prediction using Machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
An LSTM reccurent neural network (RNN), a random forest regressor and a multivariate linear regression model are used and the accuracy of their output is explored.

# The purpose of this project?
This project is useful as it will aid financial analysts as well as anyone who wishes to know the future price of Gold in order to make investment decisions such as whether to buy, hold or sell a Gold stock. Stakeholders include but not limited to:
1) Financial analysts
2) Central banks and government
3) Jewelers
4) Gold mining companies

# The Tools used?
To build the models Tensorflow, Keras, Python, various libraries such as SKLearn aswell as a plethora of packages were used in the model development stage.
